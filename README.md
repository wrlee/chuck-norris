# Chuck Norris Proverbs
Proverbs about Chuck Norris. Since I found the stream of Chuck Norris proverbs via http://api.icndb.com/jokes/, I thought I would use it to exercise some web development techniques.

I'm tempted to create a series of tutorial exercises as I put little recipes into practice.

Here are the various things I am usually playing with (reflected by its implementation in [index.html]().

- HTML
- CSS
- JavsScript
  - ECMAScript 2015/ES6
  - Promises
- jQuery
- Bootstrap
- ReactJS

## What This Does
- Implement timer as a Promise
- Use timer to fetch next
- ReactJS to manage and render content
- CSS styling of output
- ES6 features
  - Arrow functions
  - Promises
  - `fetch()` - AJAX query server for data

### Files
1. [file.txt](file.txt) — A simple text file… still displays in a browser.
1. [file.html](file.html) — A simple file, with an `.html` extension browsers _know_ how to display this.
1. [simple.html](simple.html) — A simple text file… browsers _know_ how to display this.
1. [index.html](index.html) — Latest, hottest, most advanced version (since it'll be the one run by default)

## To Do's
- Display control: auto-scroll page as items are added
- Commands to show/hide different quote categories
- Share via Twitter or Facebook
- Progressive tutorials:

## Possible Turorials
- Raw JavaScript (no jQuery)
- Revert fetch to `jquery.ajax()`
- Revert fetch/ajax() to XHR
- Revert ReactJS to HTML/jQuery
- Revert ReactJS/jQuery to HTML/JS
- Revert HTML/JS HTML only

### Class-flow
```
Text -> HTML -> Body -> CSS       -> JavaScript -> XHR -> dynamic web/JS
                     -> SASS/Less -> ES6               -> jQuery
                     -> Bootstrap -> JSX               -> ReactJS
							-> Flex/Grid
```
